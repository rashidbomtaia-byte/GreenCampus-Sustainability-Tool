# Reflection

## What I Learned
In this lab, I learned how to use GitHub for project management. I practiced creating a repository, writing a README file, creating issues, working with branches, making commits, and merging changes using pull requests. I also understood how GitHub helps organize tasks and track progress in a structured way.

## Challenges
The most challenging part was understanding how branches and pull requests work together. At first, it was confusing to know when to create a pull request and how merging actually updates the main branch. After practicing it step by step, it became clearer.

## Fun Parts
The most enjoyable part was creating feature branches and seeing the changes merge into the main branch. It was interesting to see how GitHub tracks commits and shows the history of the project visually.

## Ideas for Improvement
If I had more time, I would improve the project by adding a points system, user accounts, and data storage to track student progress. I would also improve the design and make the tool more interactive.
